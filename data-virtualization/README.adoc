= CSV-RDBMS Virtual Database 
:experimental:
:toc:
:toclevels: 4

== Introduction

This is a Spring Boot Data Virtualization application, targeted for Openshift deployment, which implements a Virtual Database (VDB) using 2 data sources:

* a MySQL database
* a CSV file

The VDB combines the credit fraus features residing on both the MySQL database (emaulatin historical data warehouse) and a CSV file (emulating recent data). The VDB can be accessed using JDBC using the URL:
----
jdbc:teiid:csvrdbmsdb.1@mm://127.0.0.1:31000
----
127.0.0.1 should be replaced by the VDB's service Cluster IP address.

== Deployment
If you don't have a login with cluster-admin role, you have to use the manual method otherwise use the deployment script which will be describd in a subsequent section.

.Manual Deployment
****

MySQL Deployment:


* use the Openshift console's Developer view to add a MySQL Database Service with persistence using Database name: mysqlsampledb; MySQL Connection Username: user; MySQL Connection Password: mypassword

* Assuming you are in the proejct hosting your mysql database and that the container name is 'mysql', Port forward to localhost using oc command:
----
oc port-forward $(oc get pods -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}' -l name=cmysql) 3306
----

* change to 'scripts' directory and issue the following command to populate the database:
----
mysql -u user -p mypassword -h 127.0.0.1 mysqlsampledb < mysql.sql
----

VDB Deployment:

Make sure you are in the project hosting your VDB, follow the steps below to deploy and configure the VDB:

* change to the 'csv-rdbms-fraud' directory and change the IP address in 'src/main/resources/application.properties' entry to the MySQL service Cluster IP address:
----
spring.datasource.sampledb.jdbc-url=jdbc:mysql://172.30.71.208:3306/mysqlsampledb
---- 

* Deply Spring Boot VDB by issuing commands:
----
oc policy add-role-to-user view -z default
oc create configmap csv-rdbms-fraud --from-file=src/main/resources/application.properties
mvn clean -P openshift fabric8:deploy
----

* Add Teiid JDBC Service: From Openshift console 'Networks', select 'csv-rdbms-fraud' and click 'YAML'. Add entries under 'ports:':

----
    - name: teiid
      protocol: TCP
      port: 31000
      targetPort: 31000
----

Highlighted in screenshot below:

* From the Openshift console 'Storage->Persistence Volume Claim', create a persistence volume claim with: Persistent Volume Claim Name: csv-rdbms; Size: 2 Mi

* From the Openshift console 'Workloads->Deployment Config', select '
csv-rdbms-fraud'. Click 'Actions->Add Storage' selecting the following parameters: Use existing claim: csv-rdbms; Mount Path: /media

* Change to 'data-virtualization' directory and issue oc command to mount the csv file:
----
oc rsync resources $(oc get pods -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}' -l app=csv-rdbms-fraud):/media/
----
****

.Automated Deployment
****
You must have Openshift cluster-admin role to obtain the available PVs before running the deployment script as a normal user. 

IMPORTANT: Important.
It is assumed that you are using a Macbook Pro to run the following commands. The automated script has only been tested on a Mac. The 'sed' command on the Mac used in the script has minor syntax differences from the Linux version.

Login using a user with cluster-admin role and execute the following command:

----
oc get pv
----

Pick two PVs with Status 'Available' with Capacity of 50Mi or more and write down their names.

Change to the directory:
----
/path/fraud-detection/data-virtualization
----

IMPORTANT: Important.
You must run the script in this directory. 

Invoke the script as follows:
----
scripts/setupDV.sh userName:userPassword ocpUrl projectName pvForMysql:pvForVdb
----

* userName:userPassword for your login account eg, developer:developer
* ocpUrl is the Openshift server URL
* projectName is the name you give to the project where the VDB and components are to be installed eg, vdb
* pvForMysql:pvForVdb are the PV names you recorded earlier

The script does the exact same steps in the manual method described earlier: deplopy MySQL, add storage for persistence, intialize the database with data, deploy the VDB, add storage for CSV data source persistence and add the Teiid JDBC service.

If the deployment fails, delete the project and try again.

****
== Accessing the VDB using JDBC
The VDB can be accessed using JDBC from application running on Openshift using the URL:
----
jdbc:teiid:csvrdbmsdb.1@mm://127.0.0.1:31000
----
127.0.0.1 should be replaced by the VDB's service Cluster IP address.

To connect to the VDB from applications running on your laptop, issue the following command:
----
oc port-forward $(oc get pods -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}' -l name=csv-rdbms-fraud) 31000
----
This will port forward port 31000 which is the VDB JDBC port. You can access the VDB using the URL:
----
jdbc:teiid:csvrdbmsdb.1@mm://127.0.0.1:31000
----
